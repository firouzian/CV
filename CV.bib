abstract = "In the current work, mechanical properties of SiC graphene sheet and influence of temperature on those properties are studied. The purpose of this work is to investigate the temperature dependency of the Young’s modulus and Bulk’s modulus of SiC graphene sheet. To reach these goals, density functional theory (DFT) and quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) methods are used to calculate energies of electrons and phonons, and consequently to obtain total energy of system. Results have been compared with existing data from literature and good agreement has been found. It is found that the effect of temperature on the mechanical properties of the SiC graphene sheet is significant."

	journal = {Materials Research Express},
	abstract = {In this work, mechanical, thermal, electronic and optical properties of Cu3NbS4 are evaluated by using density functional theory (DFT). The mechanical properties of Cu3NbS4 in the cubic phase are calculated by PBEsol approximation. By using calculated Young’s modulus and shear modulus, with Poisson’s ratio, conclude that the Cu3NbS4 structure is brittle material and also the 3D graphs of these parameters explained that the Cu3NbS4 behaves in a pseudo-symmetric manner. The calculated Debye temperature for Cu3NbS4 is 429.2 K which allowed the use of the Debye-Gruneisen model to study the thermodynamic properties below this mention temperature. The amount of CV and CP of Cu3NbS4 at zero pressure and room temperature are studied and showed that these two curves cross each other, above 200 K. Furthermore, the electronic properties of Cu3NbS4 are studied and the results explain this structure has an indirect band gap in the zero temperature. The real part of the dielectric function and the static dielectric constant curves under different strain for Cu3NbS4 are investigated. The static dielectric constant decreases under tensile strain and increases under the compressive strain. The reflectivity under the different strains shows that the main peak shifted to higher energy (blue shift) under compressive strain and it shifted to lower energy (red shift) under tensile strain. Also, this compound shows strong optical absorption, with the absorption coefficient reaching 106 cm−1 that it has potential applications in solar cell industries.}

abstract = "By means of first-principles calculations, the mechanical properties and the strain-dependent electronic band structure of the orthorhombic SnS monolayer were investigated. In an attempt to investigate the elasticity of this material, six deformation modes were considered. The stability of this configuration against these external tensions was assessed, and the second-order elastic constants were found to be C11 = 45.2 N/m, C22 = 25.3 N/m, C12 = 18.0 N/m, and C66 = 54.3 N/m. The third- and fourth-order elastic constants, which shed light on the material behavior at strains above the harmonic region, were also determined. The stress-strain relationships imply that the SnS monolayer can withstand tensile strains up to 0.075, 0.29, and 0.12 for uniaxial strain along the a direction, uniaxial strain along the b direction, and biaxial strain, respectively. Moreover, a study of the electronic band structure of the SnS monolayer shows that this indirect band gap semiconductor when exposed to a marginal uniaxial or biaxial strain (about 2%) experiences a transition to a direct band gap semiconductor with a moderate band gap (<2.7 eV). This transition merely occurs when tensile strain is exerted. Our findings suggest that under compressive strain, this semiconducting material maintains its indirect band gap nature, and the band gap predominately declines. Lastly, the band splitting that arises from spin-orbit interactions in most cases vanishes when strain is applied. However, compressive strain along the a direction and tensile strain along the b direction are two exceptions, in which the former strengthens the spin-orbit effects and for the latter, band splitting remains almost unchanged."
